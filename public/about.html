<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Elí Guzmán. I am an Electronics Engineer from Mexico city's finest school for engineers,
  the beloved IPN. I graduated in 2018. I like to design electronic circuits to solve my own everyday challenges.
  I have designed a wireless lock for the main entrance of my home. A security anti-theft system for my car using
  c++ programming, microcontrollers and electronic devices.
