<hr />
<h3>Children of men (2006)</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/child.png" width="300">
<p>Tragic story that takes you from "no hope" to "maybe there's still hope for humanity". </p>
<p>It shows all the pain and sacrifice that had to be done in order to reach an objective. </p>
<p>One of the best things of this movie are all the long un-cut shots that had to be very precise. </p>
<h3>Dazed and Confused (1993) </h3>
<img src="../assets/images/dazed.png" width="300">
<p>Pure Rock and Roll, that's all you need to know. </p>
<h3>The Deer Hunter (1978) </h3>
<img src="../assets/images/deer.png" width="300">
<p>The best Robert De Niro performance. It's a very tragic tale about a group of friends</p>
<p>affected by the horrible aftermath of war. </p>
